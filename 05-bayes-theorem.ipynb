It has a true positive rate of 90%, meaning that if someone has bayesitis, the test will correctly identify them 90% of the time. It also has a false positive rate of 5%, meaning that if someone doesn't have bayesitis, the test will incorrectly identify them as having it 5% of the time.\n",

Similarly, the base rate -- the prevalence of the disease, typically stated as something like '1% of the population is infected' -- is the probability of the outcome, also called the *base rate* -- the rate of incidnece of the disease, for example.\n",
