    "Imagine being in an experiment in a psychology lab. There are two buttons you can push. You are told to push the buttons as much as you want, and occasionally, you will get a reward; the computer display will update showing your new total. Let's say you earn 5 cents for every reward from either button. Sounds a bit weird, right? Well, you start pressing buttons. Unbeknownst to you, the button the left distributes a reward after approximately 5 presses, while the button on the right distributes a reward after approximately 10 presses. \n",

    "\n",
    "There is a pond with many ducks on it. To study foraging behavior, a team of researchers devise an experiment. They take special, veterinarian-approved 'duck chow' and crush it and then form it into morsels of a precise size (4 grams, about the size of a sugar cube). They confirm that the morsels will float for several minutes if they are thrown into water. Then two of them each take a sack with many dozens of morsels and position themselves on either end of the pond. They each have special stopwatch devices that they can set to flash on a schedule. Each time they see a flash, they throw a morsel of food. A video camera is positioned to allow the team to record the positions of the ducks as the experiment proceeds. Let's call the 'north' end of the pond Source 1, where one of the experimenters is positioned, and the south end is Source 2, where the other experimenter is positioned. Rather than talking about Experimenter 1 and 2, we will just say that Source 1 distributes food on a particluar schedule. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Scenario 2.1\n",
    "\n",
    "Source 1 distributes a 4g morsel of food every 10 seconds, and so does Source 2. The team observes that the ducks gradually distribute themselves such that about half are at each source. Once the ducks have distributed themselves and things seem stable, Source 2 slows down, and only distributes food every 20 seconds. Soon after, the ducks redistribute themselves such that approximately 2/3 of the ducks are at Source 1 and 1/3 are at Source 2; that is, they match the probability of food at the two sources. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Is this the best or optimal behavior? Why or why not? \n",
    "2. How can we explain this behavior? \n",
    "   1. Propose an explanation -- that is, start to develop a *theory* that organizes your observations and proposes *causes* -- how parameters of the experimental setup and/or behaviors of the ducks and/or internal processes in the ducks drive the observed outcomes. \n",
    "   2. A good theory makes predictions about what would happen if you changed aspects of the situation. Ideally, you try to make predictions that could *falsify* your explanation; that is, a good approach is to try to prove your theory is wrong. State how you would test your theory -- what hypotheses does it generate?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scenario 2.2\n",
    "\n",
    "Source 1 distributes a 4g morsel of food every 10 seconds, and so does Source 2. Again, the team observes that the ducks gradually distribute themselves such that about half are at each source. Once the ducks have distributed themselves, the experimenter at Source 1 switches from a sack of 4g morsels to a sack of 8g morsels. The sources continue distributing every 10 seconds, but now Source 1 has 8g morsels, while Source 2 still has 4g morsels. Soon after, the ducks redistribute themselves such that approximately 2/3 of the ducks are at Source 1 and 1/3 are at Source 2; that is, they match the probability of food at the two sources. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Consider your answer to question 2.1 above, and compare to this scenario; is the behavior described best/optimal? Why or why not? \n",
    "4. How can we explain this behavior? Can your explanation from question 2.2 above explain this case, or do you need to expand your explanation/theory? Propose an explanation that generates testable hypotheses and state how you would test your theory."
