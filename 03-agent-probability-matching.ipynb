    "### Recapping the mathematical model approach\n",
    "\n",
    "Gallistel (1990) makes a compelling case that we *can* model probability matching in groups of foraging animals by assuming each animal represents the full complexity of the situation. That is, on Gallistel's *representational* theory, each duck (in our example domain) respresents rate and magnitude of food available at each source and integrates those over time to assess the prevalence of food (size units per unit of time, e.g., $grams/minute$, although we do not assume the ducks have such specific units; in other parts of the book, Gallistel elegantly delves into how anmimals can represent time, rate, and magnitude [among other things] in a variety of domains). Once a duck has calculated (estimated) prevalence at each source, it needs to evaluate which source is preferable. A simple way to do this is simply consider the ratio of each source to the sum of both sources, e.g.: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "preference = \\frac{prevalence_{max}}{prevalence_1 + prevalence_2}\n",
    "$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "Where $prevalence_{max}$ is the larger $prevalence$, and this ratio tells us how much more preferable the larger one is. (In the previous notebook, there was also some exponential weighting that introduces a nonlinearity, but this is not crucial.) Recall that there is a hiccup here, though: if each duck does the same calculation, each duck will go toward the food source with higher prevalence. To prevent this, a $switchiness$ variable is introduced, with the idea that ducks will vary in how willing they are to change sources if they are at the less prevalent source. "

    "### Towards an Agent-Based approach\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's try modeling this system another way. Instead of devising equations that describe the system rather abstractly, let's see what it would take to simulate the moment-by-moment behavior of ducks.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, we are going to use **agent-based modeling**. This has some similarity to the cellular automata we played around with using the Game of Life simulator. But instead of our primitive elements only being fixed locations on a grid (although we did see the emergence of intercellular interactions that appeared to cohere and act as units), we are going to populate a grid with *agents* (ducks) that can navigate the grid (the pond). We will also need a method for dropping food in regions of the pond. Then we have to think about how the ducks will update their representations of food prevalence at the two sources, how they should move towards food, whether/how they should move if there is no food in the environment, how quickly they can move, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "So let's think about all the things we have to define in order to create a simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Pond size and shape (let's keep it a rectangle, so we just have to define X and Y dimensions). Let's start with a 40x40 grid.\n",
    "- Food source dimensions -- let's put them at the top and bottom of the pond, but how big should they be? Let's start with a the sources having a size based on 8: they will extend 4 cells to the left and right of the pond center, and 8 cells from the top or bottom end.\n",
    "- Number of ducks -- let's start with 50.\n",
    "- Rates and morsel magnitudes\n",
    "- How ducks will update representations\n",
    "- How many timesteps the simulation will last\n",
    "\n",
    "Please review the code below -- at least skim it. Then try the simulator below and see if you can understand how it works. We will try a few things.\n",
    "\n",
    "- For moving: ducks will first have to update their source preference, and then make a decision based on their personal *switchiness* value (which we'll distribute normally). They will update their preference, and then choose their food source by generating a random number. If that number is larger than their switchiness value, they will do a second decision. If a second random number is larger than the ratio of densities, they choose the denser source.\n",
    "    - Then, they will 'aim' at the nearest morsel of available food at their preferred source, and move to the 'best' adjacent unoccupied cell that will move them closer to that piece of food.\n",
    "    - If no food is available at their preferred source, they will move to a random adjacent unoccupied cell. If all cells are occupied, they stay where they are.\n",
    " \n",
    "### Installation\n",
    "You need to install mesa and tkinter from the command line before starting jupyter lab.\n",
    "\n",
    "`pip3 install mesa tkinter`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Crucial test\n",
    "\n",
    "When you run the code cell below, a new window should open with the simulator. If this does not happen, with or without an error message, please let me know. If there is an error message, please send that to me. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Some details\n",
    "\n",
    "1. When Representational mode is on, ducks that currently prefer Source 1 are darkblue and those that prefer Source 2 are cyan. White indicates no preference (all ducks are white when Representational mode is off). There are conditions under which ducks may be white briefly when Representational mode is on. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Food is red. Ducks turn red when they first get food and then their color gradually goes from red to white as they consume the food. If 'Food takes time' is not on, food takes 10 timesteps to consume. Otherwise, the time it takes to consume is equal to the source size. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Restart button starts a new simulation with the current parameters. If you change pond height or width, you have to click Restart for those changes to apply. Note that *image size* can change the pond size while the simulation is running, but it will be cropped if you make it bigger. To make the bigger pond work, click Restart.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Continue does just that, from current conditions with current parameters. \n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Quit button does not currently work.** To quit the current simulation, close the simulator window. \n",
    "\n",
    "6. To start a new simulation with default parameters, exit the current simulation (close simulator window) and re-run the code cell. \n",
    "\n",
    "7. The Representational and Food takes time 'sliders' work like check boxes, just toggling between 0 (off/false) and 1 (on/true). They have immedate effect when you click them, so you can click back and forth between Representational and Nonrepresentational mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. In addition to controlling pond height and width, you can control the dispersal area for each food source with 'Food % Width' and 'Food % Height'. Making these 2 small may lead to a crash/stall, if there are no locations available for food to go. Food width can go from 10% to 90%, literally meaning that is the width of the area relative to pond width. Food height can only go from 10% to 50% because 50% takes you to the midline. You'll see that making Food height bigger makes it more likely that ducks will have time to cross in Nonrepresentational mode (making pond height smaller has a similar effect). \n",

(p. 358)\n",

Is to propound a nonrepresentational model of ... a system that is altered by its past experiences in such a way that it chooses patches in proportion to their relative [densities] ... from ... observations alone ... without the system's having any internal variable[s] ... or a fortiori any operations that appropriately combine these nonexistent representatives of number, time, and magnitude. Is it possible to propound a model of the internal causation of the duck's behavior that avoids postulating an isomorphism between a system of variables and operations inside the duck and the corresponding system of number, time and magnitude external to the duck? (p. 359)\n",
    "\n",
    "As some of you have noted, his idea of a 'nonrepresentational' account still seems to require a fair amount of representation -- some way of learning which source is 'better' without explicitly tracking rate and size. However, can we make a more radically nonrepresentational version of our model? The way the code works is that when `Representational` is set to 1 (that is, when the simulator is in Representational mode), there is a procedure where each duck chooses its preferred source based on food prevalence. Then, it 'aims' for the closest morsel of uneaten food at its preferred source. \n",

    "Now keep Representational = 0 and set \"Food takes time\" to 1. When 'Food takes time' is set to 0, food takes 1 time step for ducks to consume, no matter what the magnitude (size) value is. (You could change this to a different fixed value by searching for `time_to_consume = 1` and set it to a different value.) When 'Food takes time' is set to 1, it takes a duck `size` timesteps to eat a morsel of food (e.g., if `size1` is set to 8, when a duck reaches that morsel, it will stay stationary for 8 time steps and then it will be free to seek more food). \n",

    "16. *Simulation challenge.* Another possibility might be that you would find that ducks probability match in the  representational mode even when there is 'too much' or 'too little' food for probability matching to emerge with the nonrepresentational mode. What kinds of testable predictions (i.e., predictions you could test with real ducks) might that suggest? \n",
    "17. *Programming / theoretical challenge.* Examine the code where switchiness comes into play. Does this seem like an adequate analog to what Gallistel describes? (If your answer is simply 'yes', that's fine, but then don't bother with this question!) If not, can you propose an alternative way to implement switchiness? Double bonus: modify the code to implement your proposal and compare it to the original code (to do this, save a copy of the notebook with a new name where you can introduce your modifications).\n",
    "18. *Pure programming challenge.* Can you fix the bug where many/all ducks suddenly change to red or violet and the change back? *Warning*: I have actually looked into this extensively and posted about it on matplotlib and python message boards and have had no success -- so this may not be solvable (e.g., if it is due to a bug in matplotlib).\n",
    "19. *Pure programming challenge.* This simulator would be much more useful if it saved outputs that could be analyzed later. Can you come up with a way to create data files when you run simulations?
