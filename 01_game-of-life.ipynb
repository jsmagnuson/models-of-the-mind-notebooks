    "## Conway's \"Game of Life\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Game of Life (GoL)** is a cellular automaton devised by British mathematician John Conway in 1970. It's a \"zero-player game\" -- its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input from the user / experimenter.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Definition\n",
    "The GoL consists of an 'infinite' grid of cells (that is, a torus), each of which can be 'alive' or 'dead'. The state of a cell in the next generation is determined by its current state and the number of living neighbors. The rules are simple:\n",
    "1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies (underpopulation).\n",
    "2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.\n",
    "3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies (overpopulation).\n",
    "4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell (reproduction).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conway's Motivation\n",
    "Conway developed the GoL to simulate and explore complex systems and patterns that emerge from simple rules. He was interested in creating a system that could model biological and morphological phenomena, yet be governed by straightforward principles (the simple rules). \n",
    "\n",
    "### Impact and Utility\n",
    "The GoL has proven incredibly useful in various fields including mathematics, computer science, physics, and biology. It's a classic example of how simple rules can lead to complex and unpredictable behaviors. Patterns in the Game of Life can simulate logic gates, memory storage, and even perform calculations, making it *Turing complete* (though a general-purpose computer implemented from GoL would be painfully slow). \n",
    "\n",
    "### Thus...\n",
    "... the Game of Life is more than a mathematical curiosity; it's a profound illustration of how complexity can arise from simplicity, reflecting processes observed in nature and the universe. Its enduring appeal and widespread applications underline the depth of its conceptual foundations... "

    "### Why are we using GoL for this course?\n",
    "\n",
    "GoL illustrates some really interesting principles that are relevant for Models of the Mind: e.g., how global complexity can result from simple local interactions. We are not ready for this lesson at the start of the course, though. The reason to explore this simulation is that it gives us a great example we can play with in preparation for cognitive models later on. In particular, I hope you embrace the opportunity to experiment with variables you can set, etc. This will be our first taste of actively engaging in simulations. I hope you enjoy the experience of using this notebook to engage in some scientific exploration."

    "\n",
    "Skim the code that follows. Do not worry if you do not understand it. What's more important for now is the simulation itself, which you'll find after the code. \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "`game_of_life_anim = GameOfLifeAnimation()`\n",
    "\n",
    "This creates a new object, `game_of_life_anim`, which is an instance of the `class` called `GameOfLifeAnimation`. You'll see that it has a special initialization method (`__init__`) that is called when a new class instance is defined. This includes creating the 'widgets' (buttons, etc.) the user can interact with. The next major thing that will happen is when the user clicks the `Start` button, which calls the `GameOfLifeAnimation` method, `start`. You have to work through the series of other methods that are triggered by `start`, as well as those triggered by the other buttons.\n",

    "        mathematician John Conway. The game is played on an 'infinite' grid of cells \n",

    "1. Just do a few runs. With the default parameters, how stable is the system after 200 time steps? 'Static' would mean that there are no more changes, even if there are some elements that are oscillating on and off (that is, if it settles into a a repeating pattern that it never escapes). Note that the plot stops updating after 200 timesteps by default; that stopping is not a static state, we've just cut it off. To run repeated simulations, just click the `Start` button again. \n",

    "\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. If things tend to still change after 200 timesteps, increase the number of time steps and run a few more simulations -- can you determine a value by which the system *tends* to be stable/static? If instead you find that the system becomes stable/static earlier than 200, report that value. If you are increasing the number of timesteps, try a few runs at different values. You do not need to do this for hours and hours! \n",

    "**Note.**  *You may find that the simulator gets 'confused' sometimes, such that you can't really read the timestep value at the top of the plot. This can happen if you click *`Start`* while a simulation is still running, for example. What happens is that more updates have been calculated by the simulation code faster than the plot can bd updated. If this happens, there are a few ways to fix it. (1) Press* `Pause` *and wait until it actually pauses (after all pending updates happen). You will likely have to press* `Resume` *to continue. (2) Change* `Interval` *to a larger number. This is the number of milliseconds the animation function waits before trying to plot the next update. Larger values may allow the system to work more smoothly, though I have not been able to verify that yet. (3) If all else fails, you can choose *`Restart kernel`* from the *`Kernel`* menu. Note that this will relaunch the entire notebook. In later notebooks with multiple blocks of code, if you restart the kernel, you may have to re-run all preceding code blocks before the one you are working on will work correctly (if it makes use of variables or function defintions from earlier code blocks, for example).*\n",
    "\n",
    "*Another way things can get wonky is if you have set `Timesteps` to a very large value. Currently, I have not been able to find a way to gracefully interupt a run, so you may have to wait until the maximum timestep is reached, or restart the kernel. You can tell if the system is still running by looking at the *`Python 3 (ipykernel)`* message on the bottom of the window; if it says 'busy' it is still running. There is also a message at the top right of this tab.*\n",

What happens when you make this very small? What about very big? Can you find a value that tends to lead the system to become stable before 200 ms?\n",
