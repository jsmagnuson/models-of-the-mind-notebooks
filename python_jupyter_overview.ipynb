    "\n",
    "There are various platforms you can use to run and edit Jupyter notebooks. You can run them locally on your own computer, by putting the `.ipynb` notebook file(s) in a directory, installing `jupyter lab` on your computer, and then calling `jupyter lab` from the directory where the `.ipynb` files are. Alternatively, you can put the `.ipynb` files on google drive. Then if you double-click them (or open them from the menu), they will open in **google colaboratory** (colab). However, most of the notebooks for this course will not run in colab because they depend on graphics packages not yet available in colab. \n",
    "\n",
    "### What can you do with a notebook?\n",
    "\n",
    "A note book consists of a series of **cells**. A cell is a place where you can enter either **code** or **markdown** text. Code can be executed, while markdown is rendered. In Jupyter, there is a 'play' icon at the top of the window that you use to execute either kind of cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter provides 'kernels' There are over 100 programming language kernels supported in Jupyter lab. We will focus on Python, and may sometimes use the statistical programming language `R`. Normally, you select one kernel for a notebook (e.g., *either* Python or R). If you want to use both within a notebook, there are ways to do it, but we will skip this for now.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will also occasionally use Jupyter 'directives' within notebooks to do special tasks (such as installing or loading packages, or loading data from an external source). While your Python and R code should run if you put it to a standard script outside the notebook, Jupyter directives will not.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are looking at notebooks on the course `Binder` link, you can run things, and you can save things -- but only **temporarily**. If you want to save your work after your session, you have to download it. You can upload it again when you re-open the binder link. However you are working, if you are changing things, save frequently within a session so you do not lose anything if you get disconnected, and save anything you have changed and want to keep **to your local computer** before you leave the session. Otherwise, that work will be irrevocably lost. \n",
