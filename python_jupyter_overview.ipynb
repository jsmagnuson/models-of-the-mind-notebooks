    "\n",
    "### How to run notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "There are various platforms you can use to run and edit Jupyter notebooks. You can run them locally on your own computer, by putting the `.ipynb` notebook file(s) in a directory, installing `jupyter lab` on your computer, and then calling `jupyter lab` from the directory where the `.ipynb` files are. Alternatively, you can put the `.ipynb` files on google drive. Then if you double-click them (or open them from the menu), they will open in **google colaboratory** (colab). There are some minor differences in how notebooks function in those two platforms, but we won't worry about that for now.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What can you do with a notebook?\n",
    "\n",
    "A note book consists of a series of **cells**. A cell is a place where you can enter either **code** or **markdown** text. Code can be executed, while markdown can be rendered. In Jupyter lab, there is a 'play' icon at the top of the window that you use to execute either kind of cell. In colab, markdown is rendered automatically, and the play icon shows up for code cells when you hover the mouse over the cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter provides 'kernels' There are over 100 supported in Jupyter lab. Colab is primarily for Python, but you can also use R (R is a statistical programming language; we will talk about it later). If you want to use both within a notebook, there are ways to do it, but we will skip this for now.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will also occasionally use Jupyter 'directives' within notebooks to do special tasks (such as installing or loading packages, or loading data from an external source). While your Python and R code should run if you put it to a standard script outside the notebook, Jupyter directives will not.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are looking at notebooks on the course website, you can run things, but you cannot save things. When working with local notebooks or colab, don't forget to save your notebook as you go along.\n",
    "\n",
