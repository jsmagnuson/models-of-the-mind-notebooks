    "# PROBABILITY MATCHING, PART 3a\n",

    "### Recapping the mathematical model approach\n",
    "\n",
    "Gallistel (1990) makes a compelling case that we *can* model probability matching in groups of foraging animals by assuming each animal represents the full complexity of the situation. That is, on Gallistel's *representational* theory, each duck (in our example domain) respresents rate and magnitude of food available at each source and integrates those over time to assess the prevalence of food (size units per unit of time, e.g., $grams/minute$, although we do not assume the ducks have such specific units; in other parts of the book, Gallistel elegantly delves into how anmimals can represent time, rate, and magnitude [among other things] in a variety of domains). Once a duck has calculated (estimated) prevalence at each source, it needs to evaluate which source is preferable. A simple way to do this is simply consider the ratio of each source to the sum of both sources, e.g.: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "preference = \\frac{prevalence_{max}}{prevalence_1 + prevalence_2}\n",
    "$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "Where $prevalence_{max}$ is the larger $prevalence$, and this ratio tells us how much more preferable the larger one is. (In the previous notebook, there was also some exponential weighting that introduces a nonlinearity, but this is not crucial.) Recall that there is a hiccup here, though: if each duck does the same calculation, each duck will go toward the food source with higher prevalence. To prevent this, a $switchiness$ variable is introduced, with the idea that ducks will vary in how willing they are to change sources if they are at the less prevalent source. "

    "### Towards an Agent-Based approach\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's try modeling this system another way. Instead of devising equations that describe the system rather abstractly, let's see what it would take to simulate the moment-by-moment behavior of ducks.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, we are going to use **agent-based modeling**. This has some similarity to the cellular automata we played around with using the Game of Life simulator. But instead of our primitive elements only being fixed locations on a grid (although we did see the emergence of intercellular interactions that appeared to cohere and act as units), we are going to populate a grid with *agents* (ducks) that can navigate the grid (the pond). We will also need a method for dropping food in regions of the pond. Then we have to think about how the ducks will update their representations of food prevalence at the two sources, how they should move towards food, whether/how they should move if there is no food in the environment, how quickly they can move, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "So let's think about all the things we have to define in order to create a simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Pond size and shape (let's keep it a rectangle, so we just have to define X and Y dimensions). Let's start with a 40x40 grid.\n",
    "- Food source dimensions -- let's put them at the top and bottom of the pond, but how big should they be? Let's start with a the sources having a size based on 8: they will extend 4 cells to the left and right of the pond center, and 8 cells from the top or bottom end.\n",
    "- Number of ducks -- let's start with 50.\n",
    "- Rates and morsel magnitudes\n",
    "- How ducks will update representations\n",
    "- How many timesteps the simulation will last\n",
    "\n",
    "Please review the code below -- at least skim it. Then try the simulator below and see if you can understand how it works. We will try a few things.\n",
    "\n",
    "- For moving: ducks will first have to update their source preference, and then make a decision based on their personal *switchiness* value (which we'll distribute normally). They will update their preference, and then choose their food source by generating a random number. If that number is larger than their switchiness value, they will do a second decision. If a second random number is larger than the ratio of densities, they choose the denser source.\n",
    "    - Then, they will 'aim' at the nearest morsel of available food at their preferred source, and move to the 'best' adjacent unoccupied cell that will move them closer to that piece of food.\n",
    "    - If no food is available at their preferred source, they will move to a random adjacent unoccupied cell. If all cells are occupied, they stay where they are.\n",
    " \n",
    "`Unfortunately, there is a bug in this simulator that I cannot solve. The ducks are initially blue, and food is red when it appears. If a duck reaches a morsel of food, it turns violet while it is eating (in this simulator, that is just 1 timestep). However, occasionally, *all* of the ducks turn red or violet for a timestep or two. Underlyingly, the states are all correct, which you can see if you click the 'Show text plot' button before you run a simulation. This makes a large text version of the plot and when all the ducks turn red or violet, you'll see that their states in the text plot have not changed. This seems to be a bug in the matplotlib library. Unfortunately, we just have to tolerate this for now. Sorry!` \n",

(p. 358)\n",

Is to propound a nonrepresentational model of ... a system that is altered by its past experiences in such a way that it chooses patches in proportion to their relative [densities] ... from ... observations alone ... without the system's having any internal variable[s] ... or a fortiori any operations that appropriately combine these nonexistent representatives of number, time, and magnitude. Is it possible to propound a model of the internal causation of the duck's behavior that avoids postulating an isomorphism between a system of variables and operations inside the duck and the corresponding system of number, time and magnitude external to the duck? (p. 359)\n",

    "As some of you have noted, his idea of a 'nonrepresentational' account still seems to require a fair amount of representation -- some way of learning which source is 'better' without explicitly tracking rate and size. However, can we make a more radically nonrepresentational version of our model? The way the code works is that when `Representational` is set to 1 (that is, when the simulator is in Representational mode), there is a procedure where each duck chooses its preferred source based on food prevalence. Then, it 'aims' for the closest morsel of uneaten food at its preferred source. \n",

(You could change this to a different fixed value by searching for `time_to_consume = 1` and set it to a different value.) When 'Food takes time' is set to 1, it takes a duck `size` timesteps to eat a morsel of food (e.g., if `size1` is set to 8, when a duck reaches that morsel, it will stay stationary for 8 time steps and then it will be free to seek more food). \n",

What kinds of testable predictions (i.e., predictions you could test with real ducks) might that suggest? \n",

(If your answer is simply 'yes', that's fine, but then don't bother with this question!) If not, can you propose an alternative way to implement switchiness? Double bonus: modify the code to implement your proposal and compare it to the original code (to do this, save a copy of the notebook with a new name where you can introduce your modifications).\n",
    "18. *Pure programming challenge.* Can you fix the bug where many/all ducks suddenly change to red or violet and the change back? *Warning*: I have actually looked into this extensively and posted about it on matplotlib and python message boards and have had no success -- so this may not be solvable (e.g., if it is due to a bug in matplotlib).\n",

Can you come up with a way to create data files when you run simulations?
