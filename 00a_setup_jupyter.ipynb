    "It is crucial to set up your computer for running **JupyterLab** during the first week of classes.\n",
    "Some notebooks require libraries that **are not available on Google Colab**, so you must install Python and Jupyter locally.\n",

    "If you do not have a computer you can use for this course, please talk to the instructor ASAP.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are already comfortable with Python environments (e.g., conda), you may use your own setup. Below are the simplest recommended instructions.\n",
